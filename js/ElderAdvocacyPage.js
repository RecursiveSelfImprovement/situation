        "authority to block family members from communicating with an elder. However, ",

        "make decisions regarding medical care and can occasionally restrict visitors ",

        "patient (such as elevating blood pressure or causing extreme agitation in a ",
        "dementia patient). However, this authority is not intended to be used as a ",
        "tool to settle family grievances.\n\n",
        "• The Principal's Autonomy: Legally, as long as the mother is mentally competent ",
        "(even if she has mild cognitive decline or forgetfulness), she retains the ",
        "absolute right to decide who she wants to speak with. A POA only acts as ",
        "a substitute decision-maker when the principal is fully incapacitated.\n\n",
        "• Court-Appointed Guardianship: If the sister is a court-appointed Guardian ",
        "(which is different from a private POA), Virginia has very strict rules. ",
        "Under Virginia Code § 64.2-2019.1, a guardian who wishes to restrict an ",

        "notify the restricted family member, and prove that the restriction is ",

        "abuse primarily covers physical abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation.\n\n",
        "While 'isolation' is not usually a standalone criminal charge on its own, ",
        "it is legally recognized in civil and protective contexts:\n\n",
        "• A Tool for Exploitation: In elder law, isolating an elder from their ",
        "supportive family and friends is recognized as a major warning sign of ",
        "undue influence. It is frequently used by abusers to manipulate a vulnerable ",
        "adult into changing their will, transferring assets, or giving up control ",
        "of their finances.\n\n",
        "• Adult Protective Services (APS): Because isolation is a known precursor ",
        "to financial and emotional abuse, agencies like Virginia Adult Protective ",
        "Services (APS) take reports of selective family isolation seriously. If a ",
        "family member is systematically cutting off an elder from all outside contact ",
